# Student Dropout and Academic Success Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to address the challenge of predicting student dropouts and academic success within higher education institutions. Utilizing machine learning techniques, we seek to identify students at risk early in their academic journey, enabling timely intervention strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of 4424 instances and 36 features. It includes various demographic, academic, and socio-economic factors from undergraduate students enrolled in diverse degrees. The task is formulated as a three-category classification problem with classes being 'dropout,' 'enrolled,' and 'graduate.'

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA includes statistical analysis and visualizations to understand the data distribution, potential correlations, and patterns that could impact the model's predictive capabilities.

## Machine Learning Models

Three different models are constructed and evaluated:

1. **Traditional ML Model 1**: A model like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
2. **Traditional ML Model 2**: A different traditional model, e.g., SVM or Logistic Regression.
3. **Deep Learning Model**: Implemented using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, using a split of 80% training data and 20% test data as recommended.

## Results

The performance of the models will be compared, and the insights are discussed in the context of their predictive power and potential use in academic settings.

## Conclusions and Future Work

Conclusions are drawn from the model comparisons, and recommendations are made for future improvements and research directions.
