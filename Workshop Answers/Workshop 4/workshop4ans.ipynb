    "### Enhanced Data Dictionary for the Titanic Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PassengerId**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Numeric (integer).\n",
    "   - **Description**: A unique identifier for each passenger.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Including PassengerId helps in uniquely identifying records, which is essential for data management and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Survived**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Boolean (integer encoded as 0 or 1).\n",
    "   - **Description**: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Boolean type simplifies the understanding of survival status, making it clear and binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pclass**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Categorical (ordinal).\n",
    "   - **Description**: The passenger class, with 1 being the highest class and 3 the lowest class.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Treating Pclass as ordinal acknowledges the inherent order and social hierarchy present in the class system.\n",

    "   - **Type**: Textual (string).\n",
    "   - **Description**: The full name of the passenger, potentially including titles, first names, middle names, last names, and additional information.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Expanding the description to include the structure of names can be beneficial for detailed analysis, such as family ties or social status.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sex**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Categorical (nominal).\n",
    "   - **Description**: The gender of the passenger (male or female).\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Categorical treatment of gender allows for straightforward demographic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Age**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Numeric (continuous).\n",
    "   - **Description**: The age of the passenger. Can be fractional for children less than one year old.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Treating age as a continuous variable allows for more nuanced analysis, like age distributions and correlations with survival.\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. **AgeGroup**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Categorical (ordinal).\n",
    "   - **Description**: A categorical representation of age, grouping passengers into predefined age ranges (e.g., child, teenager, adult, senior).\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Grouping ages into categories can simplify analysis and highlight age-related trends in survival rates.\n",
    "   \n",
    "8. **IsAlone**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Boolean (integer encoded as 0 or 1).\n",
    "   - **Description**: Indicates whether the passenger is traveling alone (0 if with family, 1 if alone). This can be derived from the `FamilySize` column.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Traveling alone or with family can impact a passenger's survival chances and decision-making during the disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **SibSp**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Numeric (discrete).\n",
    "   - **Description**: The number of siblings or spouses aboard.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Counting siblings and spouses provides insights into family sizes and the impact of companions on survival rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Parch**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Numeric (discrete).\n",
    "   - **Description**: The number of parents or children aboard.\n",

    "\n",
    "11. **Ticket**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Categorical (nominal).\n",
    "   - **Description**: Ticket number.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: While nominal, ticket numbers can be useful for identifying groups traveling together or ticket patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Fare**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Numeric (continuous).\n",
    "   - **Description**: The ticket fare paid by the passenger.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: As a continuous variable, fare analysis can yield insights into economic status and its correlation with survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Cabin**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Categorical (nominal).\n",
    "   - **Description**: Cabin number where the passenger stayed.\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Cabin location can be a significant factor in survival analysis and understanding passenger demographics.\n",
    "   \n",
    "14. **Deck**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Categorical (nominal).\n",
    "   - **Description**: Extracted from the `Cabin` column, representing the deck on which the cabin is located (e.g., A, B, C).\n",
    "   - **Justification**: The deck location can be crucial for survival analysis, as it might correlate with the accessibility of lifeboats and evacuation routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Embarked**: \n",
    "   - **Type**: Categorical (nominal).\n",
    "   - **Description**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).\n",
    "   - **Justification**: Provides geographical context and can be linked to passenger demographics and survival patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
